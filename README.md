# Vis-Spectrometer-based-on-the-diffraction-grating-and-Raspberry-Pi-camera.
The present project presents the implementation of a spectrometer using optoelectronic notions, 3D printing as well as image processing in Python and the control of a step-by-step engine in C.

Final spectrometer:

  The menu was designed to provide portability to the project by using a display installed directly on the device and at the same time a backup solution was implemented in the event of its failure, so that the user can further perform measurements through an external monitor.

  The user may choose the calibration order and at the same time, before the analysis is run, if he or she considers that a calibrating has not been performed satisfactorily, he/she may resume it. Both calibration buttons send to the same calibrations function just as each has its own encapsulations
